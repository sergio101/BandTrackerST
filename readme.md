# This is the home page of Band Tracker
This package will do the following:

- Keep track of the bands that are played on [Soma FM's Bagel Radio](https://somafm.com/bagel/)
- Poll the [Bands in Town API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0), looking for shows featuring the bands from Bagel Radio within n (75?) miles of your zip code.
- Present links to those shows.

It is now in its very preliminary stages, but will hopefully progress quickly.
